/**
 The `WireMockTest` class is the main point of interfacing with the `WireMockTest` library.
 
 Use this class for creation of any new network stubs.
 You may use one of the `stub` methods to create new stub mappings using the WireMock admin API, and call `resetStubs` to delete any stubs that were created using the `stub` methods.
 
 - Important: In order to use the functionality that this library offers, you must call `initializeSession` on an instance of this class.
